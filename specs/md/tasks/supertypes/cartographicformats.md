-   **[Globes](../../tasks/supertypes/globes.md)**  
Representations of the Earth, heavens, or another planet in the form of a ball.
-   **[Maps](../../tasks/supertypes/maps.md)**  
Refers to graphic or photogrammetric representations of the Earth's surface or a part of it, including physical features and political boundaries, where each point corresponds to a geographical or celestial position according to a definite scale or projection. The term may also refer to similar depictions of other planets, suns, other heavenly bodies, or areas of the heavens. Maps are typically depicted on a flat medium, such as on paper, a wall, or a computer screen.
