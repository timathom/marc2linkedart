# LUX top-level entities

Eleven top-level entities are required for use in LUX.

In LUX, top-level entities can be divided into *record-level* entities, which correspond to resources held by the library \(books, journals, databases, archival collections, etc.\), and *related* entities, which correspond to the people, places, concepts, etc., connected to those resources through some standard relationship.

-   **[Record-level entities](../concepts/record_level_entities.md)**  
Entities that correspond to resources held by the library \(books, journals, databases, archival collections, etc.\).
-   **[Related entities](../tasks/related_entities.md)**  
Entities that represent the people, places, concepts, etc., that are connected to record-level resources.

**Parent topic:**[Entity modeling](../concepts/entity_extraction.md)
