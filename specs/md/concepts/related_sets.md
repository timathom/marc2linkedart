# Sets

Membership in library collections.

Related `Set` entities are used to model membership in repository collections.

At present, all YUL holdings should be assigned to a single `Yale University Library` collection. Additional `Set` entities should be created to represent the Yale Center for British Art and the Yale University Art Gallery, both of which have some holdings represented in the library catalog.
