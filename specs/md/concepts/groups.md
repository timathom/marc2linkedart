# Groups

Entities that represent groups of people functioning collectively \(e.g., organizations and meetings/conferences\).

Group entities are represented by the `Group` class.

Group entities may function either in creator/contributor \(agent\) roles or within subject/concept structures.

For group entities that are part of name/title entries in MARC, see [Complex works](../tasks/concepts/name_title_entries.md).
