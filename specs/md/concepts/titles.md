# Titles

Names supplied for record-level resources.

Titles provide names that identify a record-level resource. There are three types of descriptive title:

-   Main title \(including non-Latin script alternatives\)

-   Sorting title \(main title with initial articles removed\)

-   Alternative title


Titles extracted from MARC `505` \(Formatted Contents Note\) are handled separately, as their own record-level entities: see [Related title entities \[draft\]](../tasks/titles/related_title_entities.md).

-   **[Main title](../tasks/titles/main_title.md)**  
Main title of the record-level resource, from MARC `245` and parallel `880` fields \(if applicable\).
-   **[Sorting title](../tasks/titles/sorting_title.md)**  
Sorting title of the record-level resource, from MARC `245` with initial articles removed.
