# People

Person entities are represented by the `Person` class.

Person entities may function either in creator/contributor \(agent\) roles or within subject/concept structures.

For person entities that are part of name/title entries in MARC, see [Complex works](../tasks/concepts/name_title_entries.md).

-   **[People as agents](../concepts/people_as_agents.md)**  
Entities extracted from MARC 100 and 700 fields.
-   **[People as subjects](../concepts/people_as_subjects.md)**  
Entities extracted from MARC 600 fields.
