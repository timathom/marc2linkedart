# Descriptive content

Content that represents attributes of an entity \(for example: identifiers, notes, publication information\).

Descriptive content may include references to top-level entities, but typically stores variable`content`values \(string literals\) with`classified_as`relationships pointing to concepts in a taxonomy or controlled vocabulary.

1.  [Embedded entities](../concepts/lux_embedded_entities.md)  
Entities that do not have a top-level identity.
2.  [Identifiers](../concepts/identifiers.md)  
Standard alphanumeric values used to uniquely identify a resource.
3.  [Names and labels](../concepts/names_and_labels.md)  
Names and labels supplied for top-level resources.
4.  [Notes and statements](../concepts/notes_and_statements.md)  
Brief texts that provide additional information about a resource, supplied by catalogers or transcribed from a resource.
5.  [Dates](../tasks/dates/dates.md)  
Date values from fixed field `008` and 26X fields.
