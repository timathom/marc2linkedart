# Places

Place entities are represented by the `Place` class.

Place entities may function either in creator/contributor \(agent\) roles, within subject/concept structures, or as associated places.

For place entities that are part of name/title entries in MARC, see [Groups with works](../tasks/concepts/name_title_entries.md) \(places as agents are considered to be jurisdictional entities, which are treated as groups\).

-   **[Top-level Place entities](../concepts/top_level_place_entities.md)**  
Place entities extracted from 008, 034, 651, 751, 6XXz.
