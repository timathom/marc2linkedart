# Works

Work entities are represented by the `LinguisticObject` class.

Work entities may function either in whole/part relationships or within subject/concept structures.

Complex work entities correspond to name/title entries in MARC, in which a person or group name is directly related to a uniform title.

Complex work entities may also appear with subject subdivisions, as part of a complex subject heading.
