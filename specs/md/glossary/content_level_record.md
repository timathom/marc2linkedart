# Content-level record

In MARC-based systems, the content/carrier model corresponds roughly to the distinction between bibliographic records and holdings plus item records.

Content-level records correspond to bib records in the ILS and are represented by the Linked Art base classes `LinguisticObject`, `VisualItem`, and `Set`.

**Note:** See [Content and carriers](../tasks/content_and_carriers.md) for more information.
