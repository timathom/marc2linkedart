# Bound-with resource

A bound-with resource is a single volume in which multiple individual objects are bound together.

In Voyager, bound-with resources are represented by a single holdings record with multiple `014` fields.

A “master” bib record is linked to the MFHD, and then the bib ID for every other object bound with the object represented by the “master” record is recorded in a separate `014` field.

**Note:** See bib `2778143` in Voyager for an example.
