# Carrier-level record

In MARC-based systems, the content/carrier model corresponds roughly to the distinction between bibliographic records and holdings plus item records.

The MARC holdings record should be treated as an aggregate `HumanMadeObject` that implicitly contains its associated items.

**Note:** See [Content and carriers](../tasks/content_and_carriers.md) for more information.
