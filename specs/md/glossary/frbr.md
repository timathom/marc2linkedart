# Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records \(FRBR\)

Conceptual model for library metadata, which has since been superseded by the Library Reference Model \(LRM\) developed by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions \(IFLA\).

**Note:** See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFLA_Library_Reference_Model) for an overview.

**Note:** The FRBR model specifies a set of "Group 1" entities: Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item. The Group 1 entities are intended to support user tasks such as finding all editions or translations of a novel.
